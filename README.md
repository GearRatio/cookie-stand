# Pat's Famous Salmon Cookies
### Project Scope
 Develop an main landing page that displays marketing information for Pat's Famous Salmon Cookies. The site must present the customer's logo, address, store hours, and additional global location.

 The customer requested the use of a salmon, as part of the main sites logo. However, these items must be provided on the public facing page.

 Additionally, the customer has requested a custom app to help track the following. Below is sample data.

| Location    | Min / Cust | Max / Cust | Avg Cookie / Sale|
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Seattle     |    23       |    65     |       6.3        |
| Tokyo       |    3        |    24     |       1.2        |
| Dubai       |    11       |    38     |        3.7       |
| Paris       |    20       |    38     |        2.3       |

### Home Page
* Customer needs custom google fonts
* A custom Google font for highlights
* A specified standard sans-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
* A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
* Specified different font colors for all three font usages
* A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
* A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
